First connect to the website
-> http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org
-> Enter the following as the username natas6 and password aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1

Once again something new. We have an input field, a button to click, and a link which says
view sourcecode. First let's try hitting submit just to see what happens.

Big surprise - wrong secret. So now let's check the source code.

<?

include "includes/secret.inc";

    if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
        if($secret == $_POST['secret']) {
        print "Access granted. The password for natas7 is <censored>";
    } else {
        print "Wrong secret";
    }
    }
?>

<form method=post>
Input secret: <input name=secret><br>
<input type=submit name=submit>
</form>

It's pretty simple source code, it essentially compares the value submitted in the text
field to the contents in a file called secret.inc. So let's see if we can access that file
to get the contents @ http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc

At this point we find the following:
<?
$secret = "FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU";
?>

So now we know our secret value. Return back to the main page and enter it into the text
field and see what happens ...

Access granted. The password for natas7 is 7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9

Bingo!
