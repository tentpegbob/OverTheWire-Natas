Something new again! This time when we visit the challenge page we get the following:
Access disallowed. You are not logged in 

Well that's strange, because we just logged in ... so let's start by checking the html source
again.

No dice ...

Well if we were suppose to login, lets check out cookies since cookies generally keep 
up with that sort of information. Not so suprisingly, we do have a cookie and the value
is set to 0. If you are interested in how cookies work in PHP a useful site is located at
http://www.phpnerds.com/article/using-cookies-in-php/2

However, let's go ahead and change the value from 0 to 1 with a cookie editor (go get one
if you don't have one installed), and then bingo! 

Access granted. The password for natas6 is aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1
