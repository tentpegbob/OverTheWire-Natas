First connect to the website
-> http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org
-> Enter the following as the username natas4 and password Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ

Something new this time! This time when we visit the challenge page we get the following:
Access disallowed. You are visiting from "" while authorized users should 
come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/" 

Ok, well I check the source code anyways, and nothing is really there. However, it does
keep track of where I have already been when I visit the page. For example, when I refresh
the page it says:

Access disallowed. You are visiting from "http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?
url=http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/" while authorized users should come only from 
"http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"

It just so happens that since I'm using Chrome I can use my handy dandy referrer editor. For
example I changed my referrer url to "i am awesome" and it resulted in the following:
Access disallowed. You are visiting from "i am awesome" while authorized users should 
come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/" 

Ok so enough playing around, let's put the correct address in! Which gives us:
Access granted. The password for natas5 is iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq 

Goal!
