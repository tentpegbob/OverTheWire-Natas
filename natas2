This is a solution guide to the Natas2 Level at 
http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org

This write-up was created on 5 March 2015.

First connect to the website
-> http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org
-> Enter the following as the username narnia2 and password ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi

Level 2 doesn't seem quite as easy. It actually says there is nothing on this page. The first
step was to check the source code and of course nothing was there. However I did see the
following snippet which I thought was interesting:

<div id="content">
There is nothing on this page
<img src="files/pixel.png">
</div>
</body></html>

So I clicked the link and was redirected to a blank page at:
http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/pixel.png

So i decided to try and see if I could access any of the directory content of the website
by deleting pixel.png so the resulting url is now http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/

At this point I was presented an index of /files consisting of pixel.png and users.txt. When
I clicked on users.txt I found the password for the next level!

Bingo! natas3:sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14
