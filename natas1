This is a solution guide to the Natas1 Level at 
http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org

This write-up was created on 5 March 2015.

First connect to the website
-> http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org
-> Enter the following as the username natas1 and password gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto

So this one seems pretty easy also, it says the password is on this page. However it
is not visible on the page itself and right clicking is blocked. So now we just need to
check the source code by using the tools from our menu instead of right clicking.

<!--The password for natas2 is ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi -->

There's our password!
