This is a solution guide to the Natas0 Level at 
http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org

This write-up was created on 5 March 2015.

First connect to the website
-> http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org
-> Enter the following as the username natas0 and password narnia0

So this one seems pretty easy, it says the password is on this page. However it
is not visible on the page itself. So my next step is to check the source code for
the page.

<!--The password for natas1 is gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto -->

There's our password at the bottom of the page!
