First connect to the website
-> http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org
-> Enter the following as the username natas3 and password sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14

Once again we are presented with a page that says there is nothing. As before I first start
by checking the source of the webpage and find this peculiar comment.

<div id="content">
There is nothing on this page
<!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... -->
</div>

So that makes me start thinking about search engines. In a nutshell the robots.txt file
on a webpage tells search engines which directories not to enter. More information about
the robots.txt file can be found @ http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html

Now my first step is to check that file by visiting http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt
At this point I am presented with the robots.txt file which contains:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /s3cr3t/

This seems like an interesting place to visit, so let's change our url again:
http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/

Another users.txt file! When we read it we find ...
natas4:Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ

Bingo!
